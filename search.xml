        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>This is the first post published on this website. For the next period of time, this site will be <strong>my official personal website as well as the blog</strong> where I may dump whatever shit I get, including but not limited to my diary, reading notes, movies recommendation, and shitty greentexts (perhaps). Since Hexo is a statistically-generated frame of blog websites, I did not expect to include the comment or discussion sections at the beginning. However, it seems that Butterfly, the theme of this website, does have a way to let visitors leave comments by establishing the connections with some external services. Thus, I plan to open the discussion section soon so that visitors can leave their thoughts (if there is any). All in all, I hope I could <strong>keep this positivity and continually bring new stuff onto this blog</strong>. </p><h1 id="Why-Blog"><a href="#Why-Blog" class="headerlink" title="Why Blog?"></a>Why Blog?</h1><p>I always believe that <strong><em>people value their own properties more than those are given</em>.</strong> I did consider of recording my posts on some social media platforms, and I say no. Why do I have to comply with the rules of those platforms when I can have my own system? Moreover, because this is the website I built from nothing (although no big setback was encountered), I value it more than my other social media accounts. Thus, I think this blog will be the best place to track my thoughts and progress.</p><h1 id="Who-are-Welcomed"><a href="#Who-are-Welcomed" class="headerlink" title="Who are Welcomed?"></a>Who are Welcomed?</h1><p>Every friendly visitor who does not break the rules of discussion.</p><h1 id="Prohibitions"><a href="#Prohibitions" class="headerlink" title="Prohibitions"></a>Prohibitions</h1><ul><li>No discussion of <strong>Politics</strong> </li><li>No <strong>Profanities</strong> </li><li>No <strong>Pornographies</strong></li><li>No <strong>Spamming</strong></li><li>No <strong>Ads</strong></li></ul><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>EDG在令人失望这方面真是从来没令人失望。</p>]]></content>
